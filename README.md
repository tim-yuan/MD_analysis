This code is written based on Li T., et al, PCCP, 13 44 19807--19813, 2011
This code is based on GROMACS 2018 or more recent versions, a make file is required from GROMACS template
It takes the index of OW atoms, and identify the solid-like clusters using Steinhardt order parameter

Note that, the code has a section to compute the histogram of the q3 distribution (uncomment the necessary lines). Please set the cutoff distance to 0.35nm in order to have an exact match to the histogram published by Li, et al, 2011.
